Largely stolen from [Ben Orenstein's dot files](https://github.com/r00k/dotfiles), but tuned to me enough that I didn't want to fork.

## Installation

  `git clone git://github.com/gkemmey/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`  
  `cd ~/.dotfiles`  
  `rake install`

  Vim plugins are managed through vundle. You'll need to install vundle to get them.

  `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`  
  Run :BundleInstall in vim.
